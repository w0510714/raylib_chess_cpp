# A Simple Chess Game
#
# The part 2 of a 5 part assignment
#
# Run w/ Raylib (I use F5)
#
# Extra Assets in assets and images
#
#
# More fixes I could do:
#   Add more helped functions
#   Reduce copied code
#   Make cleaner & better formatting
#   More comments for clarity
# 
# Things I wanted to add but didn't get around to:
#   Visually saying what game state it is (checkmate)
#   Highlighted (orange/red) for check and pinned pieces
#   Changing the chess pieces and board
#   Threefold repetition (was removed from requirements)
#
# I just wanted the neccesities done first
